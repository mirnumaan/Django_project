# Django  Based Project 

I am Numaan Bashir Mir and i have coded this project using vs code for editing and degugging , over the pipenv which is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) into the Python world . I have also included the requirement files for the project to run over your end . Also, i have used postgresql to create a secondary database for the local-host that is connected to my project, while using the djnago database for uploading the data which consisted of my main content.  

# Goal
The main purpose for my website is to help  fill that gap between different organizations and help them connect with various youtubers all over the world related to differnt genres and also pay them to launch their projects through advertesments in their vlog.
